hhpc(1) is a utility that hides the mouse pointer in X11. The method it
uses to hide the cursor was taken from the hhp program found in
xmonad-utils.

It functions by grabbing your mouse pointer at startup and replacing its
bitmap with an empty one (thus hiding it). It uses the XGrabPointer X11
function. Then, it waits for the X server to notify it when a user tries
to move or click the pointer. At this point, hhpc relinquishes control
with XUngrabPointer, replays the action the user just tried to execute
and waits for the specified number of seconds (flag -i) before trying to
grab the pointer and hide it again.
