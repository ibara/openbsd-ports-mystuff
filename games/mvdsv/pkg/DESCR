MVDSV (MultiView Demo SerVer) is a QuakeWorld server that not only
offers a multiplayer environment, but also allows you to record demos
from every player's point of view as well as provide different game
modes.

While this package and the game server are open source, one still needs
to provide the original game assets from Quake, which is not open
source. You will need to purchase the original game to use this package.
