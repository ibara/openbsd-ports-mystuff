MARST is an Algol-to-C translator. It automatically translates programs
written in the algorithmic language Algol 60 to the C programming
language.

The MARST package includes three main components:
* the translator, MARST, that translates Algol 60 programs to the C
  programming language.
* the library, ALGLIB, that contains precompiled standard Algol 60
  procedures and other necessary library routines. This library is to
  be used at linking stage. (In the distribution the name libalgol.a is
  used for this library.)
* the converter, MACVT, that allows to convert existing Algol 60
  programs from some other representations to MARST representation.

The input language of the translator is a hardware representation of
the full (level 0) Algol 60 as described in the following IFIP
document:
