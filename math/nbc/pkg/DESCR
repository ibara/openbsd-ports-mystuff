bc is an arbitrary precision calculator language. Syntax is similar to
C, but differs in many substantial areas. It supports interactive
execution of statements.

It can also be used as a simple console-based calculator.

This NetBSD version of bc contains several extensions beyond traditional
bc implementations and the POSIX draft standard.
