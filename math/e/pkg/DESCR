E is a theorem prover for full first-order logic with equality. It
accepts a problem specification, typically consisting of a number of
first-order clauses or formulas, and a conjecture, again either in
clausal or full first-order form. The system will then try to find a
formal proof for the conjecture, assuming the axioms.

If a proof is found, the system can provide a detailed list of proof
steps that can be individually verified. If the conjecture is
existential (i.e. it's of the form "there exists an X with property P"),
the latest versions can also provide possible answers (values for X).
