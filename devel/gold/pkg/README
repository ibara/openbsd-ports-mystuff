gold
====
gold is an ELF-only linker developed by Google.

It can be easily used by clang by passing the flag
-fuse-ld=gold
on the command line during the linker step.

Caveats:
* gold can create shared libs, regular pie executables, and
  -shared -pie executables. It cannot create -nopie executables of
  any kind yet.

  Help with this is greatly appreciated!
