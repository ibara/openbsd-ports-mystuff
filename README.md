#OpenBSD ports mystuff
These are ports that:
* I am working on (my name on MAINTAINER line)
* are not destined for CVS (no MAINTAINER line)
* available for you to submit to ports ("Your Name" on MAINTAINER line)

You may submit any port with "Your Name" on the MAINTAINER line; you must
properly fill that line out first before sending to ports@.

You may not submit any port with my name on the MAINTAINER line or a port
with no MAINTAINER line.
